# teach-apps

ToolsForTeach.com is an open source initiative I am trying to start. It is my belief that educators are not supported well enough by their schools or government. The educators of our youth spend countless hours outside of work grading papers and making sure they are ready for the next day. As engineers, I think we can use software to lessen this load and hopefully give back hours to our teachers so they can spend more time with their families.

This project is a collection of Single Page Web Apps that are a part of the ToolsForTeach.com website. The main website can be found on the [ToolsForTeach website GitHub repo](https://github.com/rukamir/toolsforteach-website).

List of current apps:
1. `/assistant`- audible playback of input answers for rapid manual grading.
1. `/grader`- EZ grader style web app. Select total questions and a chart is displayed to show grade for number of incorrect answers. (WIP)

No index page is available ATM because there are all linked directly from ToolsForTeach.com.
