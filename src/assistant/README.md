# Grade Assistant

## Description
Grade Assistant simulates the interaction a teacher has with a student when they are manually grading a multiple choice test. The student reads off the answers and the teacher marks the incorrent answers. This application was designed to speed up that process and make it instantly repeatable for grading many papers at once. The user only needs to input the answer key and press play to start using it.

## Instructions
The users inputs answers on the main page. There are two sets of answers that are switched between once you put in an answer, ABCDE and FGHIJ. These are the standard 5 answer sets. If you need one or the other, simply click the box on the side with the set you desire.

Once answers input is completed, click the `Play` button that is in the top bar. This opens a screen that visually displays the question number and corresponding answer choice. You can play, pause, or restart at any time. There is a control for speed that lets you control playback for slow or rapid playback.
